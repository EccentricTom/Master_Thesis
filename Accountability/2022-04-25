Completed:
- changed format of contacts to include 'is_valid' field
- developed method to replace contacts that are no longer valid
    - N.B. this method currently only checks for head of communications, and is not foolproof as some edge-cases are not
    accounted for. Will need to change this in the future.
- started creating class for data handling. This will be crucial for loading data from different souces when API calls
are included
- Find-and-replace method for contacts is now created, and will be used to replace contacts that are no longer valid.
 - N.B This method works well, except for previously mentioned edge-case.
 - started to consider how to handle future edge cases (will discuss with Christian and Jean-Claude
 - reformatted check_contacts to check entire contact list rather than sample

 To be done:
 - finish method to replace contacts that are no longer valid to create a database that will replace the invalid entries
 - explore how to handle edge cases
 - start learning how to containerize code
 - start learning FASTAPI
