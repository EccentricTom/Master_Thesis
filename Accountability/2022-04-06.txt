Completed:
    - Webscraper works more efficiently with stopword removal
    - Moved webservice call to reduce number of downloads, next step is speed up contact loop
    - created list of common acronyms to double check against standard check_work (difficult to do programmatically as
    German acronyms are created somewhat different and there would be too many exceptions)
    - Started creation of check_contacts class to start foundation of app
    - investigated edge-cases where simple google search not sufficient to check if contact still works at location,
    this might mean creating a deeper loop to do further scraping to double check

To be done:
    - Reformat Check_contacts to be more efficient
    - change columns of contact list to include a checkbox (to indicate person has left position)
    - start experimenting with how to find replacement contact
    - change valdition to not print, instead save as variables
