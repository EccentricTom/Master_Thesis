Completed:
- Basics of webscraper are now working, implementation with NER tagger feasible
- attemtped NER model, turns out to not be fit for purpose so new training corpus created with web-scraper that will hopefully improve upon previous work
- attempted use of DNS check for email validation, facing constant DNS timeouts (can be re-visited after meeting with Christian
- discovered that email search helps validate whether someone works at current insitution or not

To do tomorrow:
- Tag new training corpus for NER model
- train new NER model
- incorporate into function to check if contact is still at current work place
- consider segregated time-loops to overcome webcrawler lockout
