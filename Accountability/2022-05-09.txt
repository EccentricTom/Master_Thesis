#Notes:
searching by email is not as efficient as I thought it was, it is returning a lot of false negatives.
It is probably better to search by name and company instead, this appears to be more successful
also added clause to check if link is a linkedin profile, as the title can be used to quickly check current position
- this approach is not ideal as it relies on self-reported information, but it is better than nothing
Also changed from google to duckduckgo
- reasoning is twofold:
    - Firstly, google has a more restricted allowance for automated requests, and workarounds are far too complex
    -Secondly, google has too many ads that clog up the search results. Duckduckgo does not, and seems to be better at
    find the most relevant results (could be because of a smaller user base and so less open to corporate exploitation)

Turns of there is a limit to how many requests can be sent to duckduckgo. This means that the best approach is to use
Async to paralelise the requests and then run app in the background
    - This would mean that the API calls would be to load data and then retrieve changed data
